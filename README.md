  Program Use:

  drag any of the three seekbars to change the rgb values of red, green, and blue respectively.
  as you move the sliders the background color will change to match your selected values.
  The Hex representation will also be updated at all times for the chosen color.
  When you are happy with your color selection, click the "Save Color" button and that specified color will be added to a list of saved colors
  after saving a color the seekbars will default to white, allowing you to make a new selection.
  At any point you may click on any of your previously saved colors in order to set the seekbars and the background to the given color saved. 
  (note: this will not save the color the seekbars were positioned at before reviewing a saved color)
  (note2: to help with visibity, when the color displayed appeares dark enough the text color will swap to white, and return to black as the text return to a lighter color)

  Issues: ajusting the length/height of a listview would not make any changes when using a physical phone to debug, changes where howerver present on the virtual phone. 
  Issues2: constraints are annoying
